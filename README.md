A dumb little app to help you find yourself (aka figure out what neighborhood you are in)

#### Configurationness
look at ```package.json``` and ```bower.json``` to see dependencies.
The ```.bowerrc``` has the bower directory set to ```public/lib```

..ps.  I'm checking in the bower modules in master because i'm presently publishing this to AWS and root access to run bower install or even point to the bin in a package.json script is a no-go.

..ps.2x the Procfile is because i plan on trying this (again) as a digital ocean dokku app on a server
